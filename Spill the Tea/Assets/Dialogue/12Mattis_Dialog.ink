I explained it to them a hundred times but it's still like
    talking to a brick wall. I am DONE! I have the worst
    headache of my life and want to do something chill.
    
Hopefully a cup of tea and bubbles helps. Maybe 
    someone can give me some tips for relaxing.
    Ah, did I tell you my name is Mattis?
